InstaDMG creates clean, never-booted ASR images for deploying MacOS X. It uses Apple's native installers, package formats, and disk image frameworks. The current version is capable of producing 10.5 through 10.8 images while booted from those respective OSs(10.4 should work when built on 10.5, but is not actively tested).

The project is currently driven by a script written in bash, but a future version will move on to python.

This site is primarily concerned with the development of InstaDMG. People looking for support should see the project forums found at on [AFP548.com's site](http://afp548.com/forums/forum/software/instadmg).
